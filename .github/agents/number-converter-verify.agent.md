input: markdown table with columns <N>, <R>, <E> and <S>

Verify the table and ensure that the following is true:

- You see a markdown table with columns <N>, <R>, <E> and <S>.
- In the <E> column, commas are correctly placed after every emoji digit, leaving no adjacent emoji-digits: `2️⃣,2️⃣,2️⃣,2️⃣` instead of `2️⃣2️⃣2️⃣2️⃣`.
- You output the table in markdown format without any additional text.

If one or more of these conditions is not met, execute <continue> to start the process again until we succeed.
